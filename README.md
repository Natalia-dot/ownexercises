Hi! Welcome to my currently active GitHub repository.

Here is a little summary of what every folder is.
---27092023
   This has a silly calculation from my first or second day programming to find out the cost of my education hourly. 
   It also has a very primitive form of my idea for the Javascript project.

---28092023
   This folder contains some exercises regarding constructors and creating custom constructors.

---Libraries
   This folder is still in development. Initially, it was meant
   to be what <a href='https://github.com/Natalia-dot/ownexercises/tree/main/typescript-project'> typescript project </a> was, a showcase and training ground
   for my journey learning new libraries, but I ended up making a whole new folder from scratch. 
   Funny thing is, this was initially set to be a refactor and migration to typescript from vanilla js, from a previous project we had from react,
   but ultimately, I knew nothing about typescript back when I started this, so you can probably guess how the migration went by the state of this folder.

---typescript-project
   This folder contains my portfolio (still in development!) that I am using to learn both typescript and styled-components. As you can
   see, each commit takes a while for very subtle changes, but you know, the more I chew something over, the better I know afterwards.
