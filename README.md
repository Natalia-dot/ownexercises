## Hi! Welcome to my currently active GitHub repository.<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This is all work in progress! If you want to check my finished projects,<br>
head to <a href='https://github.com/Natalia-dot/Ejercicios'>my exercises.</a>

Here is a little summary of what every folder is.<br>
### ---27092023 <br>
   This has a silly calculation from my first or second day programming to find out the cost of my education hourly. <br>
   It also has a very primitive form of my idea for the Javascript project.<br>


### ---28092023<br>
   This folder contains some exercises regarding constructors and creating custom constructors.<br>


### ---Libraries<br>
   This folder is still in development. Initially, it was meant<br>
   to be what <a href='https://github.com/Natalia-dot/ownexercises/tree/main/typescript-project'> typescript project </a> was, a showcase and training ground<br>
   for my journey learning new libraries, but I ended up making a whole new folder from scratch. <br>
   Funny thing is, this was initially set to be a refactor and migration to typescript from vanilla js, from a previous project we had from react,<br>
   but ultimately, I knew nothing about typescript back when I started this, so you can probably guess how the migration went by the state of this folder.<br>

### ---typescript-project<br>
   This folder contains my portfolio (still in development!) that I am using to learn both typescript and styled-components. As you can<br>
   see, each commit takes a while for very subtle changes, but you know, the more I chew something over, the better I know afterwards.<br>
