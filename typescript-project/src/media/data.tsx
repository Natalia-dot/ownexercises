    title: <h3>What I do</h3>,
    text: <p>I am aiming to become a fully-fledged full-stack developer as of now. I'd say I learn at a rapid pace, and not only that, but I am <em>eager</em> to learn. Nothing feels unreachable, since I know and am well aware that all things take time and effort, and so I deem nothing impossible to learn (which I think is a perk on its own). I have the most projects in Javascript ES6, but I also developed projects with an array of technologies.</p>,
